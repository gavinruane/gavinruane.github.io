# gavinruane.github.io
Hi there! I'm Gavin, and I just launched my photogrsphy site on Github Pages. I thought I would document my process on my README.md file! Visit me at www.gavinruane.github.io. 
# index.html
My index.html page is my homepage. It's based off of the Cover Bootstrap example, with a custom background. I added a custom background by adding the "background-image: url("image.png")" property to my CSS page under the "html, body" class. Once you correctly place your photo, it should be simple to access it as the background image.
# about.html
My about.html page is the basic Bootstrap page example. I added custom text as well as copied code from Creative Commons to describe to my users the license I use on my photos. You can visit www.creativecommons.org to get your own licensing.
# Yosemite2017.html
My Yosemite2017.html page is my album collection! I'm working on adding more photos, but in the meantime, there are nine. This page is based off of the Album Bootstrap example, with a few tweaks. Bootstrap includes the ability to add descriptions to images automatically on their example album page, but I really just want viewers to see my photos. It's easy to get rid of the descriptions like I did; just delete the <p> element in the card div. I'm working on fixing a JavaScript bug (I think) that has to do with the menu button in the top right corner. When clicked, it has no action, so I'm trying to fix that.
  # What's next
  I'm looking to create some more album pages and clean up the experience. Maybe soon in the future I'll implement a sharing service because I want to share with my friends, but that might be a big project. Who knows? Thanks for reading, and contribute if you can!
